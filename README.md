# The_DarkCake

This application was built to guide the studies of people taking the PTE, the most popular English proficiency exam usually required for immigration purposes.

This is a remastered version from the original [AussieCake](https://github.com/JulioMaciel/The_AussieCake/), released in 2019. This new (and separated) version, however, was necessary to cover the new format and challenges introduced by Person in the last 3 years.
